\nsection{G.1 Context and overall objective}
%---------------------------------
\begin{flushleft}
Shared living environments often create tension between roommates. It is usually cumbersome to reach out to a roommate about messes they left behind in a shared space, concerns over bill payments, household upkeep, and more. Our project, Room8, aims to prevent these cumbersome interactions by providing an application and the necessary hardware components to help monitor the cleanliness of shared spaces, schedule tasks, track shared billing cycles, and alert roommates of any issues within the shared house.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{goal}\label{goal:first}
Create a system that monitors the cleanliness of a shared living space, such as a kitchen or a living room.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:second}
Provide roommates with a centralized platform to manage, schedule, and task household tasks.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:third}
Provide roommates with a centralized platform to manage, schedule, and track bill payments.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:fourth}
Alert and remind roommates of issues regarding issues related to the shared living spaces, reducing tension between each other.
\end{goal}

\nsection{G.2 Current situation}

\begin{flushleft}
Room8 is designed to reduce points of tension and reduce the need for frustrating dialogue commonplace with people in shared housing, especially students. Currently, in order to manage the many shared responsibilities, roommates have to utilize multiple techniques or tools such as physical calendars, notification reminders, and existing applications such as Splitwise which do not have any integrations between each other. Additionally, it is estimated that approximately 25\% students experience conflicts with a roommate, harming academic performance and inducing stress [1]. Recognizing these factors, Room8 aims to create a centralized platform that not only simplifies communication but reduces stress and conflict to improve the lives of students. 
\end{flushleft}

\nsection{G.3 Expected benefits}
\begin{flushleft}
As stated in section G.2, conflicts between roommates create more than issues in the home and involve more than just misunderstandings in scheduling tasks or living standards. By creating a centralized suite that will help roommates monitor, schedule, and coordinate, Room8 will reduce conflicts between roommates over misunderstandings and miscommunications, and allow for greater flexibility in assigning responsibilities. Additionally, reduced conflicts will lead to mental health benefits for those living in the home by lowering conflict-related stress.  Finally, Room8 is expected to improve academic performance in some students who are hindered academically by conflicts with roommates (approximately 17% of students [1]). 

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
An improvement in response times amongst roommates over household concerns.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Increased flexibility in task scheduling and management, due to the presence of a centralized application.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Improved communication and transparency over household matters between roommates.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
A reduction of events in which a roommate forgets or neglects their responsibilities to the home.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Improved household cleanliness and upkeep.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
A reduction in conflicts between roommates over household matters.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
A reduction in stress for roommates due to reduced conflicts amongst each other.\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
Improved mental health for students who experience conflicts with roommates.
\end{benefit}

\begin{benefit}\label{benefit:first}
An improvement in academic performance for students experience stress caused by issues with roommates.
\end{benefit}

\end{flushleft}

\nsection{G.4 Functionality overview}
\begin{flushleft}
    \item \textbf{User \& House Management:} The system allows students to register, create, and manage their accounts. Students are also able to create homes and invite other students. 
    
    \item \textbf{Cleanliness Management:} Students are able to set up cameras in their shared living spaces. Machine learning algorithms are used to detect messes and assign them to the students to increase accountability and to reduce communication friction. 
    
    \item \textbf{Scheduler:} The system allows users to create and manage chore and cleaning schedules. It will also send reminders to users about their assigned chores and cleaning tasks. Additionally, users are able to "book" common areas that are available within the shared space (i.e. party room, study room, etc.) to avoid conflicts 
     
    \item \textbf{Bill Splitter:} Students are able to add shared expenses to the house and keep track of who owes what. The system will automatically split the bills between the chosen students. 

    \item \textbf{Chat:} The system provides an exportable chatbot to SMS group chats to aid in home management and communication. The chatbot will be able to send remainders and notifications to the group chat about upcoming events, chores, and bills.
    
    \item \textbf{Compliance and Data Privacy:} The system follows data privacy and compliance with Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), and Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) to ensure that student's data is secure and not shared with third parties.
    
    \item \textbf{Progressive Web App:} The system is hosted as a progressive web app (PWA), so users can use it on their phones and computers.
\end{flushleft}

\nsection{G.7 Stakeholders and requirements sources}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Stakeholder} & \textbf{Category} \\ \hline
Students              & Direct  \\ \hline
Landlords and Residence Assistants         & Indirect \\ \hline
University Housing Committee & Indirect \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Stakeholders and Categories}
\end{table}

\nsubsection{G.7.1 Direct Stakeholders}
\textbf{Students Off Campus} \\ Students are the primary direct stakeholders for Room8. They are the main users of the mobile application who create houses within the app and set up the camera systems. These students seek to maintain cleanliness in their shared living spaces and establish accountability when a mess is left behind by a roommate. The application addresses common challenges faced by students in shared living arrangements, such as maintaining cleanliness, splitting expenses, and scheduling activities. \\
\\
\textbf{Students On Campus} \\ Students of are the other direct stakeholders for Room8. They are the main mainly concerned with the chore and activity scheduling aspect of the app. In most cases students living on campus do not have a kitchen and individuals are responsible for keeping their own rooms clean so these types of students would benefit from scheduling the cleaning of public areas and events that are happening.

\nsubsection{G.7.2 Indirect Stakeholders}
\textbf{Landlords} \\ Landlords are the main indirect stakeholders to the project. Landlords are renting out their homes to students and are concerned with the condition their house is kept in. They are looking to maintain the clean condition of their home which is done by holding students accountable for messes that are made.\\
\\
\textbf{Residence Assistants} \\ Resident assistants are another indirect stakeholder who would benefit from Room8 specifically the activity scheduling feature. Resident assistants are responsible for hosting events for students living on campus and Room8 provides a calendar system to make events on a shared calendar to inform students of any upcoming activities.\\
\\
\textbf{University Housing Committee} \\ The University Housing Committee is another key indirect stakeholder in the project. These committees often seek to help students transition into living in shared spaces and provide guidance and support. Room8 offers a wide range of services that address common points of frustration faced by students, which are often brought up to these university committees. By facilitating better communication and organization, Room8 helps enhance the overall living experience for students.

\nsection{E.1 Glossary}
The glossary provides definitions for the key terms used throughout the project. It includes terminology related to the system’s environment and functionality, ensuring that all parties involved have a clear understanding of the concepts and language specific to the project. This helps prevent miscommunication and fosters consistency in documentation and development.

\nsection{E.2 Components}
This section outlines the relevant external components that the system will interact with. These include existing systems or services, particularly software, that will provide or consume APIs. These interactions play a significant role in how the system operates within its broader ecosystem, impacting design and integration.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Motion-activated camera:} The app will be connected to a camera that is activated by motion in the shared space. This component is used for taking a “before” and “after” picture that serves as the input for the cleanliness detection model. \newline
  
  \item \textbf{Object detector API:} The app will utilize an object detector that performs on a pair of images (i.e. the “before” and “after” picture) taken by the motion-activated camera. Object detection enables the algorithm to quantify the difference in room states as a function of objects and their transformations.\newline 
  
  \item \textbf{Household items dataset:} The ML model will be pre-trained with a dataset containing common household and kitchen items. This will allow the object detector to classify the items it detects and is important for providing valuable output to students.\newline
   
  \item \textbf{Google calendar API:} The application will interface with Google calendar to facilitate scheduling chores and events. This is critical for Room8's chore scheduling.\newline

  \item \textbf{SMS Chatbot:} The application employs a chatbot to send notifications to students via SMS about their responsibilities in the home (i.e. cleaning their mess from shared spaces, upcoming chore deadlines, and money owed for shared bills). This helps with bookkeeping, enforcing fairness, and keeping shared spaces clean.\newline

  \item \textbf{OAuth 2.0:} The app utilizes the OAuth 2.0 protocol to manage user authentication and authorization securely. OAuth 2.0 allows Room8 to provide a seamless login experience using third-party identity providers without requiring users to create and manage separate credentials. OAuth 2.0 handles the app’s legal and privacy compliance standards.\newline
  

\end{flushleft}

\nsection{E.3 Constraints}
Constraints are non-negotiable limitations imposed on the system, stemming from external factors such as business rules or technical requirements. These restrictions must be strictly adhered to during development. Constraints can influence system design and implementation, and their fulfillment is critical to ensuring the system meets its operational requirements.
%---------------------------------
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Camera resolution:} The resolution of the motion-activated camera affects the quality of the input that is used by the object detector. Depending on the PPM of the image, there is a minimum viable object size for a given object to be classified.\newline
  
  \item \textbf{Platform compatibility:} The application must be compatible on Android and iOS to accommodate all users in the home.\newline 
  
  \item \textbf{Data privacy compliance:} The application adheres to all applicable data privacy regulations for the region in which it operates. User data must be handled with the utmost care and cannot be shared or used without explicit consent. Prior to collecting, storing, or processing any personal data, the appropriate permissions must always be obtained to ensure compliance with privacy laws and to respect user rights. \newline

\end{flushleft}
%---------------------------------


\nsection{E.4 Assumptions}
Assumptions are conditions that are presumed to be true during development to simplify system design. These are not externally enforced but are accepted for the sake of convenience or efficiency. While helpful, assumptions must be carefully evaluated, as changes in the assumed conditions could affect the system’s success or performance.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Network connectivity:} The application assumes that there is reliable internet connection. Operating under this assumption, the camera is able to transfer images to the detector and users have access to updated synchronized information when using the app.\newline

  \item \textbf{Operating system support:} The application is compatible with the versions of Android and iOS that are currently supported by mobile providers.\newline
  
  \item \textbf{Common household items dataset:} The classifier can assume that any object it comes across is a common household item that belongs to a class represented in its training data.\newline 

  \item \textbf{FoV of the camera:} The camera is stationary and the FoV is identical in any pair of “before” and “after” images.\newline

\end{flushleft}
\nsection{E.5 Effects}
This section describes how the system’s operations will influence its environment. These effects could be on processes, workflows, or other systems that interact with the system. Understanding these impacts is crucial to ensure that the system's operation aligns well with its intended environment and does not cause unintended disruptions.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Digital minimalism:} Members of the home conduct all interactions on one platform. All common virtual services are provided by the Room8 application, hence eliminating the need for other applications that clutter the digital space.\newline

  \item \textbf{Accountability:} The application promotes social responsibility and user accountability by assessing the cleanliness state of the room before/after use and quantifying the difference in the 2 states. Students are given objective feedback on how their usage of the room contributed to cleanliness and all students in the group are held accountable for their usage.\newline
  
  \item \textbf{Ease social tension:} Students living in a home can feel tense about confronting their roommates when asking them to clean up, pay them back, or do the chores they agreed to. The chatbot sends reminders about these duties, taking the pressure off students to confront each other and risk compromising their relationships.\newline 
\end{flushleft}

\nsection{E.6 Invariants}
Invariants are properties of the environment that the system must maintain throughout its operation. These are foundational conditions that must hold true at all times during system activities. Ensuring that these invariants remain intact is essential for the correct and safe functioning of the system within its environment.
\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{Limited camera presence:} The motion-activated camera is initially triggered by motion, and takes a “before” picture. When motion has not been detected for a prolonged and predefined amount of time, it takes an “after” picture. These 2 images aside, the camera does not take any pictures or footage and thus does not have any insight on the activities occurring in the living space.  
  \newline
  \item \textbf{Students' freedom to not comply:} While the application sends reminders to students for them to pay their debts or clean up their messes, it cannot enforce these events. Room8 serves as a logistical coordinator but it cannot have a direct impact on the physical environment.
  \newline

\nsection{S.1 Components}

\begin{flushleft}
  \item \textbf{1. Front-End Cluster}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \textbf{1.1 - User Authentication and House Management:} The user interface which allows the user to log in and manage their account and/or house. It depends on a corresponding back-end component and allows the user to access all other functionality within the application once authenticated.
  	\item \textbf{1.2 - ChatBot Configuration:} The view which allows users to configure their ChatBot settings. This includes features such as opting in or out of certain personal and group notifications.
  	\item \textbf{1.3 - Cleanliness Manager:} Allows users to view their relevant details within the cleanliness detection section of the application. Includes details such as history of events within the shared space (i.e. time of entry, time of exit, changes made, etc.).
  	\item \textbf{1.4 - Schedule Configuration:} Users are able to configure details related to the scheduler within this view. Options to add/remove chores (including assigned users) and events (booked spaces) are found here.
  	\item \textbf{1.5 - Bill Splitter Configuration:} The area of the application where users can input and view details regarding shared expenses. Includes configuration to add/remove/edit bills and which users to split with, as well as outstanding balances and history of balances paid. Additionally, users can manually "settle" their outstanding payments by confirming that they've been paid within this interface.
  	\end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{2. Back-End Cluster}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{2.1 - Auth and House Management Logic:} The logic for authentication and user/house details are housed here. Any updating of information (as per user request) will be carried out in this component. Authentication (through OAuth) will also be the responsibility of this software.
  	\item \textbf{2.2 - SMS Chatbot:} Responsible for sending out chatbot messages to home group chats including reminders to complete tasks, notification of cleanliness assessment, expenses due from bill splitter, or update to configuration of user/home. Has the most dependencies with other back-end components since updates in those components will drive the output of new messages from the bot.
  	\item \textbf{2.3 - Cleanliness Calculator:} Runs the algorithm to determine which changes have been made in the shared space by the identified user. Receives input from the hardware (dependenciy) and returns changes to the GUI after each event.
  	\item \textbf{2.4 - Schedule Generator:} Houses logic that deals with the scheduling aspect of the application. Generates events to be displayed to each users calendar based on whether or not they're included in a chore or event.
  	\item \textbf{2.5 - Bill Split Calculator:} Calculation of charges due for shared expenses is done within this component. It will also keep track of which expenses are due by each user and who they owe, along with a history of charges paid.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{3. Hardware Cluster}
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item \textbf{3.1 - Camera + Sensors:} All hardware used for the cleanliness calculation. Includes sensors to detect when a user enters or exits the shared space. Takes images which are sufficient quality for detecting the changes that a user makes within the space.
  \end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\nsection{P.5 Required technology elements}

\textbf{Camera} \\
A camera is used for the systems cleanliness detection aspect. A camera takes pictures for comparing the state of the shared space.\\
\\
\textbf{Motion Sensor}\\
A sensor is also used for the systems cleanliness detection aspect. The sensor detects movement which will work in unison with the camera to take pictures of the shared space.\\
\\
\textbf{Third Party Calendar API}\\
Room8's scheduler requires a calendar component where user's can book and view events and chores in a calendar. Implementing a calendar API from scratch can prove difficult and there are already many existing solutions.\\
\\
\textbf{Secure Database}\\
Users create accounts for Room8 where user and home information is stored on a secure database where sensitive information such as credentials are stored and individuals are able to change and delete accounts.\\
\\
\textbf{Third Party OAuth Service}\\
Users will sign in securely without risk of data leaks and malicious connections.\\
\\
\textbf{SMS Message Service}\\
Room8's Chatbot SMS will send messages to users using a third party messaging system that has connection to the Room8 application to send warnings and information of shared space.\\


\nsection{P.6 Risks and mitigation analysis}
\comment{Potential obstacles to meeting the schedule of P.4, and measures for adapting the plan if they do arise.}\\
\textbf{Machine Learning Model Training}\\
Finding enough data to train the machine learning algorithm to detect when a mess has been made and what detect what is altered or added in the space. Sensitivity to slight changes such as lighting is another risk with the machine learning algorithm approach. An alternative to adapt this scenario would be to use image differencing to detect changes in environment.\\
\\
\textbf{User Identification}\\
Being able to detect which user is using the shared space through the camera is a major risk. The program may not be supplied with enough information to identity which user is currently using the space. In order to work around this the program could get individuals to submit to the application that they are now using the space.\\
\\
\textbf{Scope Creep}\\
Unclear requirements and adding too many elements to the scope of the project will result in not delivering on features that are listed to be part of the application and lower quality of core functionality due to time being strain. A revisal of requirements by making requirements and functionality of system clear and concise and developing a prioritization list would mitigate the risk of scope creep.
