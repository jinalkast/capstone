\comment{Goals are "needs of the target organization, which the system will address". While the development team is the principal user of the other books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all stakeholders.}

\nsection{G.1 Context and overall objective}
%---------------------------------
\begin{flushleft}
Shared living environments often create tension between roommates. It is usually cumbersome to reach out to a roommate about messes they left behind in a shared space, concerns over bill payments, household upkeep, and more. Our project, Room8, aims to prevent these cumbersome interactions by providing an application and the necessary hardware components to help monitor the cleanliness of shared spaces, schedule tasks, track shared billing cycles, and alert roommates of any issues within the shared house.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{goal}\label{goal:first}
Create a system that monitors the cleanliness of a shared living space, such as a kitchen or a living room.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:second}
Provide roommates with a centralized platform to manage, schedule, and task household tasks.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:third}
Provide roommates with a centralized platform to manage, schedule, and track bill payments.
\end{goal}
\begin{goal}\label{goal:fourth}
Alert and remind roommates of issues regarding issues related to the shared living spaces, reducing tension between each other.
\end{goal}

\nsection{G.2 Current situation}

\begin{flushleft}
Room8 is designed to reduce points of tension and reduce the need for frustrating dialogue commonplace with people in shared housing, especially students. Currently, in order to manage the many shared responsibilities, roommates have to utilize multiple techniques or tools such as physical calendars, notification reminders, and existing applications such as Splitwise which do not have any integrations between each other. Additionally, it is estimated that approximately 25\% students experience conflicts with a roommate, harming academic performance and inducing stress [1]. Recognizing these factors, Room8 aims to create a centralized platform that not only simplifies communication but reduces stress and conflict to improve the lives of students. 
\end{flushleft}

\nsection{G.3 Expected benefits}

\nsection{G.4 Functionality overview}
\comment{Overview of the functions (behavior) of the system. Principal properties only (details are in the System book).}

\begin{flushleft}
    \item \textbf{User \& House Management:} The system allows students to register, create, and manage their accounts. Students are also able to create homes and invite other students. 
    
    \item \textbf{Cleanliness Management:} Students are able to set up cameras in their shared living spaces. Machine learning algorithms are used to detect messes and assign them to the students to increase accountability and to reduce communication friction. 
    
    \item \textbf{Scheduler:} The system allows users to create and manage chore and cleaning schedules. It will also send reminders to users about their assigned chores and cleaning tasks. Additionally, users are able to "book" common areas that are available within the shared space (i.e. party room, study room, etc.) to avoid conflicts 
     
    \item \textbf{Bill Splitter:} Students are able to add shared expenses to the house and keep track of who owes what. The system will automatically split the bills between the chosen students. 

    \item \textbf{Chat:} The system provides an exportable chatbot to SMS group chats to aid in home management and communication. The chatbot will be able to send remainders and notifications to the group chat about upcoming events, chores, and bills.
    
    \item \textbf{Compliance and Data Privacy:} The system follows data privacy and compliance with Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), and Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) to ensure that student's data is secure and not shared with third parties.
    
    \item \textbf{Progressive Web App:} The system is hosted as a progressive web app (PWA), so users can use it on their phones and computers.
\end{flushleft}

  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
