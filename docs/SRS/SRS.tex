%===============================================================

\comment{Goals are "needs of the target organization, which the system will address". While the development team is the principal user of the other books, the Goals book addresses a wider audience: essentially, all stakeholders.}

\nsection{G.1 Context and overall objective}
\comment{High-level view of the project: organizational context and reason for building a system.} 
%---------------------------------
\notEmpty{}
%---------------------------------

\begin{goal}\label{goal:first}
This is a goal example. If you need explicit (and automatic) numbering, you can use the definitions in the \texttt{.tex} template.
Is is refined by \ref{req:memo}
\end{goal}

\begin{req}\label{req:cross}
This is a requirement example. It illustrates how numbering is continuous and cross-types (if this is what you need).
\end{req}
    
\nsection{G.2 Current situation}
\comment{Current state of processes to be addressed by the project and the resulting system.}

\begin{req}\label{req:memo}
This is a requirement example. 
It refines \ref{goal:first}
\end{req}
    
\nsection{G.3 Expected benefits}
\comment{New processes, or improvement to existing processes, made possible by the projectâ€™s results.}
%---------------------------------
\notEmpty{}

\nsection{G.4 Functionality overview}
\comment{Overview of the functions (behavior) of the system. Principal properties only (details are in the System book).}

% user management
% registration, landlord accounts, student accounts
% home management, join home, leave home, create home

% cleanliness management -> the part that assigns cleanliness and messes to people using ML and camera in living space

% Schedule -> chiore and cleaning schedule and reminders, assigning to people, bill scheduling

% bill splitter -> splitting bills between people in the home, splitwise tab basically

% chat -> chat bot exporter to help with home management

% compliance and data privacy -> data privacy and compliance with laws to ensure your photos arent just shared and passwords arent just leaked

% PWA -> progressive web app, so you can use it on your phone and computer

\begin{flushleft}
    \item \textbf{User \& House Management:} The system allows students to register, create, and manage their accounts. Students are also able to create homes and invite other students. 
    
    \item \textbf{Cleanliness Management:} Students are able to set up cameras in their shared living spaces. Machine learning algorithms are used to detect messes and assign them to the students to increase accountability and to reduce communication friction. 
    
    \item \textbf{Scheduler:} The system allows users to create and manage chore and cleaning schedules. It will also send reminders to users about their assigned chores and cleaning tasks. Additionally, users are able to "book" common areas that are available within the shared space (i.e. party room, study room, etc.) to avoid conflicts 
     
    \item \textbf{Bill Splitter:} Students are able to add shared expenses to the house and keep track of who owes what. The system will automatically split the bills between the chosen students. 

    \item \textbf{Chat:} The system provides an exportable chatbot to SMS group chats to aid in home management and communication. The chatbot will be able to send remainders and notifications to the group chat about upcoming events, chores, and bills.
    
    \item \textbf{Compliance and Data Privacy:} The system follows data privacy and compliance with Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), and Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) to ensure that student's data is secure and not shared with third parties.
    
    \item \textbf{Progressive Web App:} The system is hosted as a progressive web app (PWA), so users can use it on their phones and computers.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
